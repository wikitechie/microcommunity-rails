MicroCommunity README

# Overview

MicroCommunity is a social platform that allows individuals, groups and communities to create and interact with popular and customized content types without the need for specialized platforms for each new content type or each new interaction with some content.


# Development Status

We are currently focused on building a simple version of the MicroCommunity idea without using Semantic Web technologies.

We are still at the beginning, and any help would be highly welcomed! You might be interested in posting your ideas to the mailing list:
