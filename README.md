# Overview

MicroCommunity is a social platform that allows individuals, groups and communities to create and interact with popular and customized content types without the need for specialized platforms for each new content type or each new interaction with some content. 

In the same time it encourages you to build your own micro customized community, it also favors that you  always interact and integrate with larger communities and larger pools of content, so that social networks and content can accumulate over time in a button fashion unlike traditional social production platforms.

The main two goals of the platform are:
* Allowing emergent and flexible community tools rather than packaged ones
* Taking the potential of aggregating the content produced by those communities in a customized and dynamic manner

# Development Road map

We are currently focused on building a simple version of the MicroCommunity idea on a single website. We are calling that NanoCommunity stage!

So we'll have a single website which is considered as a global repository of different basic types of content (e.g. wiki pages, Q&As, bookmarks...). There is an important feature which is
groups that provide a social experience. The special thing about these groups is that content created inside these groups is automatically aggregated into the main repository of content. 

We hope that extending the scope of the idea beyond a single website (using Linked Data and Federated Social Web), will lower the barrier for a lot of hidden innovation in the social media platforms and will be a step towards federating content production platforms - and that's the ultimate dream behind MicroCommunity.
